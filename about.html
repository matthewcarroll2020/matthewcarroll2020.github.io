    <p id="para">Hello all! My name is Matt and I am a Junior at URI. I have switched my majors a few times but have always loved computers and software so I believe computer science is
    perfect for me! I enjoy fishing and weightlifting as well. I fish both fresh and saltwater and love to cook fresh fish and seafood when I get a good catch! 
    As you can probably assume by my pictures, fishing is my favorite and I have recently been doing much more saltwater fishing compared to fresh. 
    The first picture is me and a false albacore and the second is my first atlantic bonito cuaght on fly tackle!</p>
